My name is Hongiun Liu(Jan). I'm an undergraduate at CHU KOCHENHONORS COLLEGE of Zhejiang University with dual degree in bothComputer Science and Environmental Resource Management

My Research Experience
======
The following section will introduce some of my explorations in scientific research so far. If there are details you find interesting that are not elaborated upon below, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Project: Extending Capabilities of Large Language Models for Knowledge-Intensive Financial Exam QA

• Construct a dataset about Complex Financial Exam QA with a hybrid of textual and tabular content and require college-level knowledge in the finance domain for effective resolution.

• Provide expert-annotated, detailed solution references in Python program format for each QA in the dataset, ensuring a high-quality benchmark for LLM assessment.

• Evaluate a wide spectrum of LLMs on our newly constructed dataset with different prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thoughts and Program-of-Thoughts. The current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4 with Program-of-Thoughts) achieves only 45.4% accuracy, leaving substantial room for improvement.

• Use the question as the retrieval query,  acting as a knowledge retrieval module to retrieve the top-n knowledge terms with the highest similarities from our constructed knowledge bank and enhance the capabilities of LLMs for solving knowledge-intensive hybrid QA.


How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
