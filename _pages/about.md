My name is Hongiun Liu(Jan). I'm an undergraduate at CHU KOCHENHONORS COLLEGE of Zhejiang University with dual degree in bothComputer Science and Environmental Resource Management.
 My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Armon Cohan](https://armancohan.com/) of Yale University & Allen Institute for AI (AI2). I was advised by [Prof. Chen Zhao](http://www.chenz.umiacs.io/) from NYU Shanghai & New York University.

My Research Experience
======
The following section will introduce some of my explorations in scientific research so far. If there are details you find interesting that are not elaborated upon below, please do not hesitate to contact me.

New York University Research Assistant

**Project: Extending Capabilities of Large Language Models for Knowledge-Intensive Financial Exam QA**

*Advisors: Arman Cohan & Chen Zhao, July 2023 - Present*

• Construct a dataset about Complex Financial Exam QA with a hybrid of textual and tabular content and require college-level knowledge in the finance domain for effective resolution.

• Provide expert-annotated, detailed solution references in Python program format for each QA in the dataset, ensuring a high-quality benchmark for LLM assessment.

• Evaluate a wide spectrum of LLMs on our newly constructed dataset with different prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thoughts and Program-of-Thoughts. The current best-performing system (i.e., GPT-4 with Program-of-Thoughts) achieves only 45.4% accuracy, leaving substantial room for improvement.

• Use the question as the retrieval query,  acting as a knowledge retrieval module to retrieve the top-n knowledge terms with the highest similarities from our constructed knowledge bank and enhance the capabilities of LLMs for solving knowledge-intensive hybrid QA.

**Project: Use Machine Learning to Establish a Mapping Relationship from Genetic Variation to Phenotypic Diversity**

*Advisor: Jieping Ye, Oct 2022 - June 2023*

• Spearheaded the annotation of 3D scan data for the skulls of bird species, identifying key points and lines to delineate structural features. Conducted preprocessing of the point cloud data, involving detailed annotation of specific features and conversion of data formats for enhanced usability and analysis.

• Implemented a systematic approach for correlating genomic data with phenotypic traits, focusing on beak development genes and their association with beak width, length, and body mass.

• Applied statistical and machine learning methods commonly used in Bio career, including PCA for dimensionality reduction, ANOVA for inter-group differences, and various regression models (simple linear, polynomial, Lasso & Group Lasso) to uncover complex relationships.

• Conducted gene annotation and feature extraction from protein sequences, leveraging an array of trained models such as ProteinBert-Tape and MSA Transformer to extract significant information regarding protein structure and function.

• Collaborated in a multidisciplinary team to rank genes based on their correlation with phenotype data, integrating ecological measurement data for comprehensive analysis.

• Establish a phenotypic prediction model, which linked relationships between multiple genes and phenotype traits and achieved 84% accuracy.

**Project: Financial Statement Fraud and Valuation Misestimation Issues Detection**

*Advisor: Xili Zhang, Sept 2021 - Feb 2022*

• Constructed a dataset based on the financial reports of 100 companies over the past ten years.

• By performing a chi-square test, five indicators of accounts receivable turnover, inventory turnover, cash ratio, intellectual property ratio, and current ratio were identified as significant factors for detecting companies that engage in financial statement fraud. These factors were then used to establish data classification labels.

• Based on restructured data, evaluate various kinds of recognition models for value estimation, such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks.

Imperial Data Science Online Winter School 2022
------
*Winter School, Jan 2022 – June 2022*

• Acquired a fundamental understanding of machine learning and data science

• Fine-tuned the model's parameters to enable the use of machine learning for identifying brain tumor information.
